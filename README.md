# product-analytics-portfolio
Hi! I'm Kateryna - I work at the intersection of business, data, and technology. 
Iâ€™m currently focusing on building hands-on projects in product and data analytics to deepen my skills and move toward a more data-driven role.

This repository stores examples of deliverables I can prepare

ðŸŽ¯ I'm currently focused on building hands-on experience in product analytics using Python, SQL, and real-world data. 
My goal is to transition into a data or product analyst role by solving practical business problems and sharing my work.

ðŸš§ Coming Soon:
- **User Retention Analysis**: Analyze cohort retention and product activation using a simulated dataset. (Python + pandas + data storytelling)
- **A/B Test Analysis** (planned): Explore conversion impact of design changes using statistical testing.
